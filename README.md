# 🗺️ YEEPING - Tinder for Travelling in Thailand

## 🚧 Problem Statement: The Challenge of Adaptive & Personalized Travel

### 🧩 The Problem
Travel planning today looks easy, but it rarely feels personal.
Most travel apps recommend the same famous places seen on social media. As a result, travelers end up following identical routes—crowded cafés, overvisited landmarks, and “must-see” spots—regardless of their personality, time, or travel style. An introvert looking for calm, or an adventure seeker wanting hidden experiences, often gets the same suggestions.

This creates three major problems:

1.  **🚫 Travel is not truly personalized**
    Current itineraries are “one-size-fits-all.” They don’t adapt to who the traveler is, how much time they have, or how they want to experience a place.

2.  **⛈️ Travel plans break easily**
    Static itineraries fail when unexpected events happen—such as flooding, road closures, or overcrowding. When plans break, travelers are left without safe or meaningful alternatives.

3.  **💸 Local communities don’t benefit equally**
    Because travelers follow social media trends, money flows repeatedly to the same famous locations. Small local businesses and lesser-known communities are left out, leading to poor income distribution within the city.

**Travel becomes a checklist of popular spots—not an engaging, resilient, or locally supportive experience.**

### 💡 The Solution: YEEPING — Travel That Adapts to You and the City

**YEEPING** is a dynamic local travel web application focused on Chiang Mai, Thailand, designed to make travel more personal, resilient, and impactful.

1.  **🎨 Personalized Routing**
    YEEPING builds itineraries based on:
    *   **Personality Mode:** Introvert 🌿, Extrovert 🎉, or Adventure 🧗
    *   **Time Available:** 1 Day ☀️, 2 Days 🌙, or Custom trips
    This ensures travelers experience Chiang Mai in a way that truly fits them, not social media trends.

2.  **🛡️ Adaptive Safety & Emergency Planning**
    YEEPING actively responds to real-world disruptions such as floods or area closures by:
    *   Rerouting travelers away from unsafe zones
    *   Suggesting safe, nearby alternatives
    Travel plans stay flexible and reliable—even when conditions change.

3.  **🪙 Gamified Local Exploration**
    YEEPING turns travel into an interactive journey:
    *   Users “check in” by uploading photos 📸 at destinations
    *   Earn coins and track their exploration progress
    *   Are encouraged to visit lesser-known local spots, spreading tourism income to local communities

### 🚀 Impact
YEEPING transforms travel from passive sightseeing into a personalized, adaptive, and community-supporting experience—helping travelers discover Chiang Mai beyond social media while supporting local livelihoods.
